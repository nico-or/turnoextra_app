# Boardgame Price Aggregator

A web app that helps board game buyers find the best prices available in local game stores. The goal is to provide a service similar to [SoloTodo](www.solotodo.cl).

## Dependencies

- **Ruby**: 3.4
  - Uses new language features like the `it` keyword.
  - The `Gemfile` includes gems recently removed from the standard library (e.g., `csv`, `m_mutex`).
- **ChromeDriver**
  - The Tanakai spiders currently use the simpler :mechanize driver, but may switch to `:selenium_chrome` for JavaScript-heavy websites.
